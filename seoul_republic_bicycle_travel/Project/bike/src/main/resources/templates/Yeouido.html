        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> This is the perfect time to go on a trip to the Hangang River. You’ll only need the help of two bicycle wheels to enjoy a scenic ride through Hangang Parks bypassing some of Seoul’s major bridges. Start from Yeouido, the center of Seoul’s politics, media and finance, and you’ll reach Yeouido Hangang Park in no time. It’s cyclists’ much-loved course as it offers a blend of Seoul’s skyline, including 63 Building in harmony with the serene Hangang River. Keep riding through Cascade Square by the floating stage to Yeouido Station and you’ll arrive at Saetgang Ecological Park and be greeted by thick bushes. It is Korea’s first ecological park, established in 1997, and maintains a natural ecosystem environment rather than neatly trimmed. The pedestrian trail and bicycle lanes are divided in the park that runs along the Saetgang River in Yeouido.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Now, let’s run from Saetgang Ecological Park along the riverside of Yeouinaru Station to Banpodaegyo Bridge, which comes into sight after Wonhyodaegyo Bridge and Hangangdaegyo Bridge. The southern end of Banpodaegyo Bridge is known among cyclists as the easiest route across the river. Banpo Hangang Park is often less crowded than Yeouido Park. Look around Sebitseom Island, a complex cultural space floating on the river beside Banpodaegyo Bridge, and have a snack at Mini Stop with an extraordinary view of the Hangang River.
